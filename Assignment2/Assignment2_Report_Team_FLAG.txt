Statistics for each scheduling algorithms:
1. FCFS
Avg Turnaround time = 43.82359
Avg Waiting time        = 38.25895
Avg Response time   = 38.189177
Throughput               = 16.6
Comment: worst performance of all, but less overhead. 


2. Shortest Job First:
Avg Turnaround time = 9.62067
Avg Waiting time    = 7.4463587
Avg Response time   = 6.9195237
Throughput           = 37.2
Comment: Provided that we can accurately predict the run time for each process, the shortest job first provides very good performance.


3. Shortest Remaining Time
Avg Turnaround time = 5.9128976
Avg Waiting time        = 3.9244332
Avg Response time   = 3.8756115
Throughput               = 40.0
Comment: SRT algorithm has the best throughput, and also good performance on all other statistics, but it might introduce a lot of overhead doing the process switching. Since we don’t count the overhead in this assignment, SRT gives the best performance of all.


4. Round Robin:
Avg Turnaround time = 38.109867
Avg Waiting time    = 36.823734
Avg Response time   = 7.569867
Throughput           = 4.0
Comment: Round Robin provides very short response time because every process evenly  get the chance to run, but since the number of process are relatively high (100) compare to the run time for each process(10). The throughput is the lowest among all the algorithems.


5.Highest priority First non-preemptive.
Avg Turnaround time = 27.85968
Avg Waiting time        = 28.326086
Avg Response time   = 22.290974
Throughput               = 18.4
Comment: Better performance than FCFS


6. Highest priority first preemptive.
Avg Turnaround time = 24.506968
Avg Waiting time    = 19.355991
Avg Response time   = 19.80629
Throughput           = 17.0
Comment: Performance is not as good as SJF and SRT, but the algorithm does not depends on the prediction of run time.


7. Highest priority first preemptive with promotion 
Avg Turnaround time = 45.840126
Avg Waiting time    = 40.893723
Avg Response time   = 39.33597
Throughput           = 18.2
Comment: Sometimes performance is a little better than the HPF without promotion, but implementation is more complex. The performance boost is not obvious with small number of processes (100)


 To sum up, SJF and SRT gives the best performance in all aspects. FCFS has the worst performance of all. RR has good response time, but has worst throughput. HPF(preemptive and nonpreemptive) seems to be a good choice in reality, since we don’t always get to know a process’s runtime in advance.
